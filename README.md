A demangler which will work until https://demangler.com/ works :)


We support mangled symbols generated by GCC, G++, MSVC and Java only.

Simply enter any text containing obfuscated symbols in the window below, and press "Demangle it!"

Using Demangle as a web API

You can demangle text programatically by making a POST request to:

https://demangler.com/raw
The body of the request should be encoded as a classic www-url encoded form content, or JSON or XML, with a single parameter input. You can use this for example to create a shell script that will demangle the output of another program:

#!/bin/bash
curl --data-urlencode input@- https://demangler.com/raw
Which you can use like this:

nm libmylib.a | demangle.sh
